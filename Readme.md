# rust-tor-launcher
This is a exe design for launching a server using tor
where all you have to do is either bind a command or shell/batch script and that's literally it. The Rust Version is discrete and 
tiny making it very easy to sneak in and out as needed...

You can find more documentation on different ways to use this in the
docs section of this repo.


## TODOS:
- [ ] Documentation and examples of ways to use it.
- [ ] Cleanup Source code it currently looks sloppy.
- [ ] Provide argument parser if needed.
